    <section>
      <p>We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>This is an unofficial BigCommerce Slack community and is in no way affiliated with BigCommerce, please consider these guidelines an extension of the official BigCommerce Devs slack code of conduct  and the BigCommerce community code of conduct. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>Welcome to BigComChat! We'd love to meet you. Please introduce yourself in #welcome and join the conversation.</p>

      <h3>Set up your profile</h3>
      <p>We want to encourage a safe & productive environment and so we ask that you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use your real name</li>
        <li>Show where you work by updating your name, title or status.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Smaller closed communities</h3>

      <p>While most of our channels are public, we do have a small number of private channels. If you would like to be in one of the following channels, please message an appropriate admin mentioned in <a href="https://bigcomchat.slack.com/archives/C057JHG5T5M/p1684319730906949">this pinned post</a>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>merchant-only</li>
        <li>agency-only</li>
        <li>tech-partner-only</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Engagement Guidelines</h2>

      <h3>Please DO;</h3>

      <h4>Be helpful</h4>
      <p>Share your expertise and knowledge. We're all here to learn and collaborate with each other. This only works when we are generous and open to share.</p>

      <h4>Be mindful and respectful</h4>
      <p>There will be a wide variety of skill sets, tool preferences, and other preferences represented in this Slack. Please provide the respect and patience you would want from those around you.</p>

      <h4>Be resourceful</h4>
      <p>In addition to our helpful community, don't forget to utilize all of the official BigCommerce support and developer documentation and resources that are available.</p>

      <h3>Please DON'T:</h3>

      <h4>Harass others</h4>
      <p>Any offensive statements, unwelcome comments, or threatening behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.</p>

      <h4>Use this Slack Community as Tech Support</h4>
      <p>This is a peer-to-peer community. It should not be used as a replacement for BigCommerce support channels or engaging with a professional (developer, designer, consultant etc).</p>

      <h4>Promote competitors</h4>
      <p>Like other BigCommerce communities, this is not a space to promote or market the services of another ecommerce platform.</p>

      <h4>Spam channels</h4>
      <p>When posting your message, please use the appropriate channel for posting your message. It is unacceptable to simply copy/paste your message across multiple channels for added visibility.</p>

      <h4>Offer unsolicited paid services</h4>
      <p>If a member is asking questions or posting problems in public/private channels, it is unacceptable to message the user directly, publicly or privately, to offer your services unless the user has specifically requested this information.</p>

      <h4>Misuse Direct Messaging</h4>
      <p>Please don't DM other members without asking first. Our stance is that private conversations can't help anyone else in the Community. Your questions are likely not unique, and other people can learn from them when they're asked in a public channel.</p>

      <h4>Call without permission</h4>
      <p>Slack allows the use of voice/video calling within its platform. It is unacceptable to abuse this feature by calling users directly without their permission. We understand sometimes mistakes happen and buttons are clicked by accident. If this happens, be professional and simply send an apology message to the user.</p>

      <h2>Slack etiquette</h2>

      <h4>Cohesive Topics (Threaded Messages)</h4>
      <p>One of the great features of Slack is its ability for threaded comments. To keep conversations consolidated and readable, we recommend using this feature. It helps keep the main channels clean and groups the topic of conversations into one place.</p>

      <h4>GIFs and Emojis</h4>
      <p>We encourage you to have fun and use emojis (Slack reactions) and GIFs to help you communicate and express yourself. Please be mindful of the content and context when using GIFs inside of channels or threaded comments. Likewise, Slack offers emoji to express emotion in regards to comments, or “reactions”. Please be mindful of the emoji you use when communicating with others.</p>

      <h4>Voice/Video Calls and Screen Sharing</h4>
      <p>Slack provides the ability for users to use Voice/Video Calling with the added ability to have screen sharing. When using these features be mindful and respectful of others. Use good judgement when sharing your screen and be mindful of other windows that may be open on your computer containing sensitive or personal information.</p>

      <h4>Slack “Apps” Usage</h4>
      <p>Slack has the ability to add Applications to a workspace, expanding the functionality of Slack. We do not allow users to install apps on their own to the Slack Workspace. Any app installations to the workspace will be done by one of the admins.</p>

      <h4>Private Channels</h4>
      <p>Private channels are moderated only by those members who are invited to that channel. They are given a degree of autonomy, and this will be maintained so long as this trust is not abused. Do not invite people into private channels who did not consent to being there. Code of Conduct violations regarding discussion from private channels will be subject to the same consideration as in public channels.</p>

      <h4>Message Retention</h4>
      <p>Because this is a free Slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of BigCommerceDevs. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.</p>

      <h4>Logs and Records</h4>
      <p>Please be mindful that things you say here have the potential to become public. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public. Use your judgement to protect IP and legally protected information.</p>

      <h2>Breach of guidelines</h2>

      <h4>Reporting Issues or inappropriate behavior</h3>

We will respond as promptly as possible and will listen and work to resolve the matter.</p>

      <h4>Consequences</h3>
      <p>Members asked to stop any behaviors violating our Code of Conduct are expected to comply immediately. The admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including removing a participant from this Slack.</p>
